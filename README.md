# compiler-paulistinha

Compiler developed as a final project for the Compilers course at Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana.

This compiler was developed for the language also developed by Paulistinha. Here, all tokens (terminals and non-terminals of the language) were implemented, as follows, error handling by the panic synchronization method, syntax tree and visual graphical interface.

Developed in Java (javacc) using Eclipse as IDE and Window Builder to create the interface.
